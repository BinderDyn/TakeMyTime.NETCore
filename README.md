# TakeMyTime.NETCore

"Managing your productive time was never that easy! Display statistics, measure your progress and get things done!"

This project was originally created to experiment with .NET Core 3.1 and WPF. It does NOT follow best practices or common knowledge about MVVM-Patterns. It barely implements them but was intended as a playground. If you plan to use this software for your own work and you are eager to improve it, contact me or issue a pull request. I'll be happy for each found bug or new feature I haven't thought of. I do not earn money with this piece of software and do not intend to do so. If you like it and want to honor my effort just let me know. I won't be receiving donations but would be happy if you would donate to charity instead!
